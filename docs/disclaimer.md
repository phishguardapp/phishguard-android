# PhishGuard Android - Important Disclaimer

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

PhishGuard Android is actively being developed and improved. While we strive for accuracy, **this VPN app may occasionally show false positives (flagging legitimate sites as suspicious) or false negatives (missing actual phishing sites)**. Always exercise your own judgment and due diligence when browsing the web.

---

## No Guarantee of Accuracy

PhishGuard uses multiple detection methods including network traffic analysis, domain age checking, SSL certificate validation, and pattern recognition. However:

- **No phishing detector is 100% accurate.** Sophisticated phishing sites may evade detection.
- **False positives can occur.** Legitimate sites may be flagged due to being new, using uncommon SSL providers, or containing certain keywords.
- **Detection takes time.** Very new phishing sites may not be detected immediately.
- **Techniques evolve.** Attackers constantly develop new methods to bypass detection.

PhishGuard is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. The developers and distributors of PhishGuard:

- Are **not responsible** for any damages, losses, or security breaches that may occur while using this VPN app
- Do **not guarantee** that all phishing sites will be detected
- Are **not liable** for false positives that may affect your browsing experience

## Your Responsibility

**You are ultimately responsible for your online safety.** PhishGuard is a tool to assist you, not replace your judgment. You should:

- Always verify URLs before entering sensitive information
- Be skeptical of unsolicited emails, messages, or links
- Never share passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information unless you're certain the site is legitimate
- Use additional security measures like two-factor authentication
- Keep your browser and operating system updated
- Report suspicious sites to the appropriate authorities

---

## Best Practices for Safe Browsing

- **Verify URLs carefully** - Check for misspellings or unusual domains
- **Look for HTTPS** - Legitimate sites use secure connections
- **Be wary of urgency** - Phishing often creates false urgency
- **Use strong passwords** - Unique passwords for each site
- **Enable 2FA** - Two-factor authentication adds extra security
- **Trust your instincts** - If something feels wrong, it probably is
- **Verify independently** - Contact companies directly if you're unsure

## If a Legitimate Site is Flagged

PhishGuard may occasionally flag legitimate sites. Common reasons include very new domains, uncommon SSL certificates, free hosting platforms, or certain keywords. If you trust a site and believe it's a false positive, you can report it through the app's support feature to help us improve our detection algorithms.
