### Main Description

**Stay Safe from Phishing Scams**

PhishGuard protects you from phishing websites, scam links, and fraudulent sites in real-time. Using advanced pattern detection and security analysis, PhishGuard alerts you before you visit dangerous websites.

**🛡️ Real-Time Protection**
• Monitors network traffic for phishing attempts
• Instant alerts for dangerous websites

**🔒 Privacy-First Design**
• All analysis happens on your device
• No data sent to external servers

**⚡ How It Works**

PhishGuard uses a local VPN to monitor domain names you visit. When you browse the web or use apps, PhishGuard checks each domain against:

• Known phishing patterns
• Suspicious keywords (login, verify, account)
• Dangerous domain extensions (.tk, .ml, etc.)
• Homograph attacks (lookalike characters)
• Excessive subdomains
• Direct IP addresses

If a threat is detected, you receive an immediate notification with:
• Risk level (Dangerous or Suspicious)
• Confidence score
• Detailed reasons for the alert
• Recommendations for staying safe

**🌟 Key Features**

✓ Real-time phishing detection
✓ High-priority threat notifications
✓ Manual URL checking tool
✓ Works with all browsers and apps
✓ No account or registration required
✓ Lightweight and battery-efficient

**🔐 About Our VPN**

PhishGuard uses Android's VPN service for security monitoring:

• **Local Only**: Traffic is analyzed on your device, not routed through external servers
• **Direct Connection**: Your internet goes directly to websites
• **No Logging**: We don't store your browsing history

**⚠️ Important Notes**
