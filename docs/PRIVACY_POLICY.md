# Privacy Policy for PhishGuard

**Last Updated**: December 5, 2024

## Introduction

PhishGuard ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles information when you use our phishing protection service.

## Information We Collect

### Information Processed Locally

PhishGuard analyzes network traffic **locally on your device** to detect phishing attempts. Specifically:

- **Domain Names**: We analyze domain names from your network requests to check for phishing patterns
- **DNS Queries**: We monitor DNS lookups to identify potentially malicious websites
- **URL Patterns**: We examine URL structures for suspicious characteristics

**Important**: This analysis happens **entirely on your device**. We do not transmit, store, or collect this information.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Personal information from websites
- ❌ Passwords or credentials
- ❌ Payment information
- ❌ Email content
- ❌ Messages or communications
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Device identifiers for tracking
- ❌ Any personally identifiable information (PII)

## How We Use Information

### Local Analysis Only

All threat detection happens on your device:

1. **Real-time Analysis**: Domains are analyzed as you browse
2. **Pattern Matching**: We check against known phishing patterns
3. **Threat Alerts**: You receive notifications for suspicious sites
4. **Immediate Disposal**: No data is stored after analysis

### No Data Transmission

- We do **not** send your browsing data to our servers
- We do **not** send your data to third parties
- We do **not** create profiles based on your activity
- We do **not** track your behavior across apps or websites

## VPN Service

### How Our VPN Works

PhishGuard uses Android's VPN service to monitor network traffic for security purposes:

- **Local VPN**: Traffic is analyzed locally on your device
- **Direct Connection**: Your internet traffic goes directly to websites (not through our servers)
- **No Proxy**: We don't route your traffic through external servers
- **Transparent**: You maintain your normal internet connection

### What the VPN Does

- ✅ Monitors domain names for phishing detection
- ✅ Analyzes URL patterns for suspicious characteristics
- ✅ Provides real-time security alerts

### What the VPN Does NOT Do

- ❌ Route traffic through external servers
- ❌ Modify or inject content into web pages
- ❌ Collect or store your browsing history
- ❌ Track your online activity
- ❌ Sell your data to third parties

## Data Storage and Retention

### No Data Storage

PhishGuard does **not** store:
- Browsing history
- Visited domains
- Network activity logs
- User behavior data

### Temporary Processing

Domain names are processed in device memory for real-time analysis and immediately discarded. No persistent storage occurs.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, rent, or trade your information with:
- Third parties
- Advertisers
- Data brokers
- Analytics companies
- Any external entities

## Third-Party Services

### No Third-Party Tracking

PhishGuard does not integrate:
- Analytics services (no Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.)

### Open Source Components

PhishGuard uses open-source libraries for core functionality:
- **tun2socks**: Network packet forwarding (local only)
- **Android VPN API**: System-level VPN service

These components do not collect or transmit data.

## Children's Privacy

PhishGuard does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Our service is designed for general audiences and does not target children.

## Security

### On-Device Security

## Your Rights and Choices

### Control Over Protection

You have complete control:
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn protection on or off anytime

## Summary

**In Plain English:**

PhishGuard checks websites you visit for phishing attempts. This checking happens on your phone, not on our servers. We don't collect, store, or share your browsing data. Ever.

Think of it like antivirus software - it scans files on your computer without sending them anywhere. PhishGuard does the same for websites.
